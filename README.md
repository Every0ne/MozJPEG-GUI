# MozJPEG GUI
Windows cjpeg.exe GUI for easy file conversion by drag&amp;drop. Done in AutoIt.

## How?
Drop the _MozJPEG GUI_ file in the same location as _cjpeg.exe_ file, launch it, drag&drop your files. Converted files will get barfed out in the same place as originals, with an added prefix. Accepted files are _BMP_, _PNG_ and _JPG_.

You can get a Windows binary of _cjpeg.exe_ from [https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg/releases](here) for instance.

## Why?
Cuz' sometimes I get tired of keystroking everything in console like some animal.
